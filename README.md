## My process

### Built with

- [Angular](https://angular.io/) - JS library
- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) - UI framework
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - For backend
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Learned a ton. It's unfortunate Firestore in Firebase has limited query configurations. I wanted to do partial matches however only pure matches are allowed. In Angular I learned a ton of new ways for implementing custom components. Creating custom form inputs through Control Value Accessors was definitly one of them. Also using Angular Fire to connect with Firebase.
